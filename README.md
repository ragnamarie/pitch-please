# pitch-please

is a booking tool for Berliner football teams to plan their seasons by booking available training hours that have been distributed to them by the local sports department (Sportamt). Beyound that the occupancies of each field will be visible to everyone in order to utilize their full capacity and avoid available slots on public sports facilities to be illegally sold to private parties.

## Background

Every year Berliner football clubs have to apply for slots on either football pitches or gymnasiums at the local sports department. Depending on how many teams the clubs have it will then make a number of training hours available to them. The individual clubs will then distrubute these slots amongst their teams.

However, it happens that some clubs do not end up using their assigned slots (e.g. because one of their teams has been disbanded). Often these slots are then not used or worse: sold to private parties.

To prevent this Berliner football clubs have already requested a tool from the government which makes the occupancy of each pitch transparent and simplifies reporting clubs that do not seem to claim their training hours. To this date the clubs are still waiting for its release.
